# Service script. Will be called by ffservice with the following 
# parameters:
#	$1 : command
#	$2 : Optional name of configuration script file, if it exists.
#            MUST be sourced to override default settings.
#
# List of commands. Unknown/unsupported commands must exit with

#
# start		Start service
# stop		Stop service
# getconfig	Called by "ffservice config" to initialize empty service
#		configuration file. It is expected that a configuration
#		file template with current settings is printed to stdout.
# info          Provide some information about the service by printing
#		the following name=value pairs which are suitable for
#		being interpreted by "eval":
#		DAEMONS : space separated list of daemon names (as used
#			  by ffdaemon) started by this process. Can also
#			  be empty, a value list must be in the format
#			  \"value1 value 2 ...\"
#		LOG     : Full path of a log file, if the service has one
#		STATUS  : on|off (if the service has anything to say
#			  about this). If empty, the output of DAEMONS
#			  will be used to determine "on" (at least one
#			  DAEMON active) or "off" state.
