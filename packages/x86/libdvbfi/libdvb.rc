# RTP traffic to these host:port entries is replaced with 
# the transport stream data to the port number requested by this host + 2.
# 0.0.0.0 is a wildcard for all hosts, -1 for all ports.

#RTP_REDIR0 192.168.0.40:9000
#RTP_REDIR1 192.168.0.40:-1
#RTP_REDIR2 0.0.0.0:9004
#RTP_REDIR3 0.0.0.0:-1

# OR: Use our own method to send out RTP packets to all hosts:
#
#RTP_REDIR0 0.0.0.0

# By default, RTP/UDP packets of size 1316 are sent.
# If the receiver supports larger mss, a multiple of 1316 can be given here
# (up to 1316*20=26320).

#UDP_SIZE 26320
